# Node Intercom

An interface for speaking to intercom.io API. There complete docs can be found here - http://docs.intercom.io/api


## Installation

I always recommend you bundle your dependencies with your application. To do
this, create a `package.json` file in the root of your project with the minimum
information...

    {
      "name": "yourapplication",
      "version": "0.1.0",
      "dependencies": {
        "node-intercom": "0.0.7"
      }
    }

Then run the following command using `npm`

    npm install && npm install mocha gulp -g

OR if you just want to start playing with the library in your project, run

    npm install node-intercom


## API Overview

    var settings = {
      "api_key": "your_API_key",
      "app_id": "your_APP_ID"
    }

    var intercom = require('node-intercom').app(settings);

    intercom.users.get('test@example.com',function(code, body){
        // code is the Request Status Code from the API
        // body is the Response Body as a Buffer.
        console.log(code, body.toString());
    });

See tests/index.js for more examples.

## Testing

    npm test
